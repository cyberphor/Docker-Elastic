## Docker Elastic

### Troubleshooting
This file documents some of the issues I have encountered and resolved while deploying a Docker-based Elastic stack.

**Max Memory is Too Low**  
> max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]

If you are getting the error above on a Windows-based computer, you can either (1) run the provided script or (2) invoke the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), append `vm.max_map_count = 262144` to `/etc/sysctl.conf` and reload the WSL's kernel parameters. `sysctl` is a utility used for configuring kernel parameters at runtime. `sysctl -p` forces the kernel to reload parameters such as those saved in `/etc/sysctl.conf`. All of this is necessary when the WSL is used to run containers. By default, WSL-based containers are limited in the amount of memory they are allowed to use.  
```bash
bash Set-VirtualMemorySize.sh
```

**"Target" Option Was Not Specified**  
>  ECS compatibility is enabled but `target` option was not specified. This may cause fields to be set at the top-level of the event where they are likely to clash with the Elastic Common Schema. 

NOTE: I've since removed the fix below and only specify the port for Logstash to listen on. 

```bash
input {
  http {
    port => 1337
    additional_codecs => {} # <-- i added this line
    codec => json {
      target => "[document]"
    }
  }
}
```
